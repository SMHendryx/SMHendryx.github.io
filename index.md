I currently lead the generative AI machine learning team at [Scale AI](https://scale.com/). At Scale, I have led research on [agents](https://x.com/SeanHendryx/status/1836853180967031098), alignment [[1](https://x.com/SeanHendryx/status/1849522272824123686), [2](https://x.com/SeanHendryx/status/1854710361687310418)], and reasoning and put AI services into production for data engine quality & efficiency. I created [AFM-1](https://scale.com/blog/afm1), Scale's first vision foundation model and led ML for human-AI collaboration in vision and language data engines. I led the teams that developed & productionized models for spam, cheating, and fraud detection, LLM-based graders, and in-house custom reward models for quality control. I have built a team that drove business value out of AI research while simultaneously publishing our findings and acquiring top research talent.

I am currently focused on researching and building systems that most effectively leverage human supervision for the advancement of frontier models. Since 2015, I have been interested in developing models that can rapidly improve, by training powerful base models either though [meta-learning](https://meta-learn.github.io/2020/papers/44_paper.pdf), [joint training](https://scale.com/blog/afm1), [online learning](https://neurips2021workshopfl.github.io/NFFL-2021/papers/2021/Hendryx2021.pdf), and improved calibration [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14743), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12129)]. Generally, I'm interested in technologies that can self-improve, collaborate with people, and improve human well-being.

Previously, I researched and developed deep learning systems at [Standard Cognition](https://standard.ai/), where I worked on video action recognition research, model training automation, transfer learning, domain adaptation, metrics development, hard mining, and model robustness. I also led migration of our core human pose estimation stack from tensorflow 1 to pytorch and implemented the real time production video inference service with TorchScript, Rust, and GStreamer. Before that, I was the first engineer at [Explorer AI](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/explorer-ai), an autonomous vehicle mapping company which was acquired by Standard Cognition.

I double mastered at the University of Arizona, focusing on machine learning and remote sensing, respectively. During that time, I was a researcher with the [ML4AI lab](https://ml4ai.github.io/) in the School of Information. I was advised by Dr. Clayton Morrison and Dr. Greg Barron-Gafford.
