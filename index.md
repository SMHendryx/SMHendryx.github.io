I currently build build deep learning systems for multi-camera, machine vision problems at [Standard Cognition](https://standard.ai/). I have mainly been focused on model training automation and transfer learning and domain adaptation systems for reducing generalization error in production. 

In my research, I am interested in AI topics such as developing more intelligent meta-learning algorithms and bounds on their generalization and optimality. On longer term topics, I am interested in models that can develop explanations, introspect their own uncertainty, and communicate with us. It is my hope that research into these lines of inquiry elucidates fundamental properties on the nature of intelligence.
