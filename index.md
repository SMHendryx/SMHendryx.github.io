I currently lead the Frontier Data Research team at [Scale AI](https://scale.com/), where we work on RL, reasoning, and agents. At Scale, I have contributed to research on [agents](https://x.com/SeanHendryx/status/1836853180967031098), alignment [[1](https://x.com/SeanHendryx/status/1849522272824123686), [2](https://x.com/SeanHendryx/status/1854710361687310418)], and [reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03733). I led applied ML for human-AI collaboration in both language and vision data engines. Our team developed agentic services and trained in-house LLMs to improve quality control and efficiency of the GenAI data engine. Additionally we created services for spam, cheating, & fraud detection. Previously, I created [AFM-1](https://scale.com/blog/afm1), Scale's vision foundation model. The team I built brought in researchers & engineers from top universities & labs, growing to ~20 research engineers & scientists. Our work created business value out of AI research by ensuring high quality product lines and driving net-new consumption at $XXXM/yr. Simultaneously, we increased Scale's presence in the AI research community by publishing work in leading conferences (including [Scale's first main-track NeurIPS paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/d46f127a80dc58cbc0732a717285c43a-Abstract-Conference.html)) and releasing [industry-leading benchmarks](https://scale.com/leaderboard).

My career goal is to understand intelligence and apply it towards improved human well-being. Towards this end, since 2015 I have been interested in studying systems that learn faster and are more reliable with work on [meta-learning](https://meta-learn.github.io/2020/papers/44_paper.pdf), [joint training](https://scale.com/blog/afm1), [online learning](https://neurips2021workshopfl.github.io/NFFL-2021/papers/2021/Hendryx2021.pdf), and improved calibration [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14743), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12129)]. Generally, I'm interested in technologies that can self-improve, collaborate with people, and improve human well-being.

Previously, I researched and developed deep learning systems at [Standard Cognition](https://standard.ai/), where I worked on video action recognition research, model training automation, transfer learning, domain adaptation, metrics development, hard mining, and model robustness. I also led migration of our core human pose estimation stack from tensorflow 1 to pytorch and implemented the real time production video inference service with TorchScript, Rust, and GStreamer. Before that, I was the first engineer at [Explorer AI](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/explorer-ai), an autonomous vehicle mapping company which was acquired by Standard Cognition.

I double mastered at the University of Arizona, focusing on machine learning and remote sensing, respectively. During that time, I was a researcher with the [ML4AI lab](https://ml4ai.github.io/) in the School of Information. I was advised by Dr. Clayton Morrison and Dr. Greg Barron-Gafford.
